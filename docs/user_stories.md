USER STORIES

As a non-logged in user, I only have access to the main page that contains snippets of stories on the main page and am able to read the full completed stories, once I click on it. If I want to be able to contribute to the stories, or create new stories, I would need to register. Only registered users may start a story.

As a logged-in user, I am able to write my own stories and contribute to other stories, that are not completed yet. Once those stories are complete, users are not able to add to it. Logged-in users can upvote a contribution to a story and can the number of upvotes.
Only the creator of the story may mark the story as complete and can accept a contribution to merge it with their story.
